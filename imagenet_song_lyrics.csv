00:05,A person looking at the sky
00:25,A robot singing a song
00:58,I'm curling in my sleeping bag
01:03,all dressed up in my shower cap
01:07,soon I'll be on the largest screen
01:12,with my head in a guillotine
01:15,My hair smells like an old dishrag
01:18,my face looks like a used doormat
01:21,my spine is like a horizontal bar
01:26,These are just some things you'll find in ImageNet
01:30,A thousand cuts of joy but mostly things to pet
01:32,be my weasel
01:34,be my pig
01:36,be my badger
01:38,on an offshore rig
01:40,find a beagle
01:43,catch a slug
01:48,and bring them all to my whiskey jug
01:50,watch out for the king snake
01:51,the vine snake
01:52,the green snake
01:54,and don't forget the night snake
01:55,the sea snake
01:57,and the pug
01:59,find a beagle
02:01,catch a slug
02:05,and bring them all to my whiskey jug
02:12,And there I sit in a rocking chair
02:17,looking for my purple hare
02:21,what's inside this wooden chest
02:26,maybe my bulletproof vest
02:29,I hear a border collie cry
02:32,A bernese mountain dog goes by
02:35,And all the while two hummingbirds stay near
02:40,These are just some things you'll find in ImageNet
02:44,A thousand cuts of joy but mostly things to pet
02:47,be my weasel
02:49,be my pig
02:51,be my badger
02:53,on an offshore rig
02:55,find a beagle
02:58,catch a slug
03:01,and bring them all to my whiskey jug
03:04,watch out for the king snake
03:05,the vine snake
03:06,the green snake
03:08,and don't forget the night snake
03:09,the sea snake
03:10,and the pug
03:13,find a beagle
03:15,catch a slug
03:20,and bring them all to my whiskey jug
03:22,be my weasel
03:24,be my pig
03:26,be my badger
03:29,on an offshore rig
03:31,find a beagle
03:33,catch a slug
03:38,and bring them all to my whiskey jug
